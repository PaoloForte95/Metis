Prompt

I want you to solve a planning problem for a {task_name} task in a {scenario_name} scenario.

You need to:
- {task_description}
- {scenario_description}

Objects that are allowed on a table: 

-Cutlery

-Bowls

-Plates

-Fruits

-Mugs

-Cups

-Baskets

-Glass


- Generate a start and goal waypoint for each object on the table, but not the food. Call wp1s, wp2s, etc.. the start and wp1f, wp2f,etc the goal waypoints.|

- Each food is defined as food type; baskets and plate as container; the others as locatable



An example of planning problem definition is:
(define (problem <task_id>)

    (:domain <task_id>)

    (:objects

        plate - container

        pear - food

        fork - locatable

        glass - locatable

        mug - locatable

        screwdriver - locatable

        robot - robot

        wp1s wp2s wp3s wp4s wp5s wp6s - location

        wp1f wp2f wp3f wp4f wp5f - location

        out_location - location 

        home1 - location

    )

    (:init

        (at plate wp1s)

        (at pear wp2s)

        (at glass wp3s)

        (at mug wp4s)

        (at screwdriver wp5s)

        (at fork wp6f)

        (at robot1 home)

        (free robot1)

      

    )

    (:goal

        (and

        (at plate wp1f)

        (on pear plate)

        (at glass wp3f)

        (at mug wp4f)

        (at screwdriver out_location)

        )

    )

)

Your task is :

1. Generate the planning problem definition in PDDL format based on the provided image and the objects detected in the image (for the initial state) and user input in form of natural language (for the goal state).


Just generate the file and do not put any explanation.

In this problem you have:

- pear: 1
